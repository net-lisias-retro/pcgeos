COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		LogOpenFile
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Open the log file.

CALLED BY:	TcpipInit

PASS:		nothing

RETURN:		nothing

DESTROYED:	ax, bx, cx, dx, ds

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		Open the log file in the document directory.  Create one
		if it doesn't already exist, else set file position at
		end of file.

		Save the log file's handle.

NOTE:  	Must use FE_NONE instead of FE_DENY_WRITE to be able to look
	at the file from Unix while the driver has it open.
